    abstract  = {The design of a user interface usable by blind people sets specific usability requirements that are unnecessary for sighted users. These requirements focus on task adequacy, dimensional trade-off, behaviour equivalence, semantic loss avoidance and device-independency. Consequently, the development of human-computer interfaces (HCI) that are based on task, domain, dialog, presentation, platform and user models has to be modified to take into account these requirements. This paper presents a user interface model for blind people, which incorporates these usability requirements into the above HCI models. A framework implementing the model has been developed and implemented in an electronic speaking bilingual software environment for blind or visually impaired people and in an educational system for children with special educational needs.},

    abstract  = {This course will explore the current state of the art in computer user interfaces
(UIs) designed for people with disabilities, and will identify problems in the current
models that may warrant alternative strategies. The course will begin by exploring
a variety of UIs designed for people who are unable to see, hear, or use their hands,
as well as those designed for people with dyslexia and other processing disabilities.
Attendees will discover that the wide spectrum of available UIs makes it possible
for almost anyone to use information technology. However, they will also experience
examples of how this UI model breaks down when the software, document, form or website
users are trying to access is designed in a way that fails to support user diversity.
Current models are dependent on designers, developers, and authors to create products
that are accessible, and these models are largely failing. Despite laws that require
accessible design, and standards and guidelines that define it, people with disabilities
still face daunting barriers that prevent them from accessing technology. This course
will explore this problem in some depth, and participants will brainstorm possible
solutions. This course is intended for all audiences. Everyone who designs or develops
interfaces, and everyone who authors content, should be aware of how the interface
or content they create affects individuals with disabilities. Attendees will learn
current techniques and best practices for minimizing accessibility barriers, and will
have an opportunity to contribute to the discussion regarding possible alternative
solutions.},

    abstract  = {Cognitive accessibility aims to make content more accessible for people with intellectual
and learning disabilities. By following existing standards, it is possible to improve
cognitive accessibility, making text content more readable and understandable while,
at the same time, designing a more accessible user interface. In this work, cognitive
accessibility design patterns and their application in the Easier web system's user
interface are presented. The Easier web system, which is targeted at people with cognitive
disabilities, provides a tool that assists in understanding text content. In addition
to the monitoring of design techniques, user tests have been carried out in order
to provide a preliminary evaluation of the level of cognitive accessibility of the
Easier system's interface.},
